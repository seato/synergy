 * Prerequisite:  IMPORTANT!  The IXM's that download this code MUST have an
 * integer ID programmed in beforehand.  Use the IXM BIOS to set the board
 * NAME ((n=NAME) according to the help menu).  Note that the input is stored
 * on the boards in base-36 so that it can accept letters in addition to
 * integers (26 letters + 10 integers = 36 symbols).  You don't need an
 * 'integer' ID, but it's certainly a good idea since the IXM's are typically
 * shipped with a unique 8 digit identifying sticker.
 * Info on accessing the BIOS can be found in the Antipasto Hardware Wiki on
 * http://antipastohw.pbworks.com/w/page/30205779/IXM-Bios-Tutorial.
 *
 * Description:  This is a demonstration of the performance qualities of the IXM.
 * Each board performs a portion of a larger calculation (finding the exact value
 * of PI).  To divide up this calculation, all boards are aware of the number of
 * active boards available as well as an order to determine what piece each board
 * does.  Each board then calculates and shares its results with all other boards
 * per round.  A blue LED lights up to signify that it is currently processing; a
 * blue + green combo signifies that the boards are increasing in accuracy while
 * a blue + red combo signifies a decrease in accuracy.  Once an IXM hits its
 * accuracy goal, it will light its green LED and continue to generate points for
 * other boards in the grid if they're not complete with their calculations.
 *
 * Button Function:
 * None.
 *
 * Terminal Commands:
 * >> x         - force a reboot to all IXM's in the grid
 * >> t         - request to stop sending heart-beat packets (starts with "r"
 *                followed by a combination of numbers and commas) and to start
 *                displaying the local IXM's internal table which will update on
 *                an interval
 * >> dA.B        - request to initiate a calculation for the (A.B)_th degree of
 *                accuracy.  The result per round for PI (points IN circle) is
 *                broadcast the moment it is generated.  Replace the 'A.B' with
 *                the (A.B)_th degree of accuracy of pi to calculate, for example:
 *                d95.00 is a request to calculate PI that is at least the 95.00%
 *                accurate.  It is necessary to type the degree of accuracy with a
 *                integer followed by a decimal.  There is also a limit programmed
 *                within the boards as to how high of a degree of accuracy of PI
 *                they can take which can be found within the header file as
 *                "DOA_THRESHOLD".  Change this for endless calculating!
 *
 * Notes:
 * The boards do not rely on a slave/master setup, meaning that every internal
 * could potentially be different.  A weakness is that IXM(s) in the grid could
 * have discordant data.  However, this setup also allows IXM's to have no single
 * point of failure should an arbitrary board encounter a data/network fault
 * (assuming grid with redundant networking paths).
 * Every additional board increases the total computation potential per round, thus
 * reducing the expected time to reach a projected degree of accuracy (but
 * probability likes to screw around from time to time).
